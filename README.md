random-alert-timer
==================

plays a sound every X minutes, with X being between a min and max setting

Wanted this to play with some Quantified Self, 7 habits-style ideas: this should be run in the background, and when the timer makes a sound you need to write down what you're doing. The randomness makes sure cheating is impractical :)

PS: made this really quick so might not follow node style

Prerequisites:

```
npm install
```

Usage:

```
node randomTimer.js
 ```
